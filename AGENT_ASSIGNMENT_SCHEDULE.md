# ðŸ¤– Agent Assignment Schedule - Multi-Agent Parallel Execution

**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Ready for Deployment
**Total Agents**: 24 (maximum concurrent: 4)
**Execution Model**: Rolling wave deployment with dependency management

---

## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTION STRATEGY

This plan assigns all 8 remaining batches to specific agents with staggered start times based on dependencies. Agents work in parallel within each wave, with new waves starting as soon as dependencies clear.

### Key Principles:
- **No file conflicts**: Each agent owns specific files (zero overlap)
- **Dependency enforcement**: Agents can't start until prerequisite batches complete
- **Maximum parallelization**: Up to 4 agents work simultaneously when dependencies allow
- **Clear hand-offs**: Each wave has defined completion criteria before next wave starts

## ðŸ”„ DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT

### Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path** (blocks final completion):
```
Wave 0 â†’ Wave 1 â†’ Wave 2 â†’ Wave 3 â†’ Wave 4 â†’ Wave 6 â†’ Wave 7 â†’ Wave 8
```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Wave 5 can start as soon as Wave 1 complete (doesn't wait for Wave 2, 3)
- Wave 5 runs parallel to late stages of Wave 4

### Blocking Matrix

| Wave | Blocks | Must Complete Before |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Wave 0 | Wave 1 | All subsequent waves |

| Wave 2 | Wave 3, 4 | Wave 3, 4 |
| Wave 3 | Wave 4 | Wave 4 |
| Wave 4 | Wave 5, 6 | Wave 5, 6 |
| Wave 5 | Wave 6 | Wave 6 |
| Wave 6 | Wave 7 | Wave 7 |
| Wave 7 | Wave 8 | Wave 8 |

## ðŸš¨ ESCALATION PROCEDURES

### If Agent Blocked
1. **Check dependencies**: Verify prerequisite batches merged
2. **Check file conflicts**: Another agent may be working on same files
3. **Check acceptance criteria**: Previous wave may not be fully complete
4. **Escalate to tech lead**: If blocked >4 hours

### If Wave Delayed
1. **Identify bottleneck**: Which agent is behind?
2. **Redistribute work**: Can another agent help?
3. **Adjust timeline**: Update downstream waves
4. **Communicate impact**: Notify all agents in subsequent waves

### If Critical Bug Found
1. **Create hotfix branch**: `hotfix/critical-bug-description`
2. **Fix immediately**: Don't wait for wave completion
3. **Merge to main ASAP**: Priority over feature work
4. **Rebase feature branches**: All agents rebase on fixed main

---

## ðŸ“ž COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

### Daily Standups (Async)
Each agent posts in Slack/Discord:
- Yesterday: What I completed
- Today: What I'm working on
- Blockers: Any issues preventing progress

### Wave Transition Meetings (30 min)
When wave completes:
- Review acceptance criteria
- Demo completed work
- Hand off to next wave
- Address questions

### Emergency Sync (As needed)
If critical blocker arises
