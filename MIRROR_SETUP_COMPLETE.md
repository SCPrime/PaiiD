### 🔒 Backend Dependency Audit: 1 VULNERABILITY FOUND

**Summary:**
- **Total Packages Audited:** 85
- **Vulnerabilities Found:** 1 (in indirect dependency)
- **Severity:** Low to Medium (timing attack)

**Vulnerability Details:**

| Package | Version | Vulnerability | Fix Available | Impact |
|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| ecdsa | 0.19.1 | GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp | ❌ No | Timing attack on P-256 curve |

**Description:**
The `ecdsa` library (used by `python-jose` for JWT authentication) is subject to a Minerva timing attack on the P-256 curve. An attacker with the ability to time signature operations may be able to leak the internal nonce, potentially leading to private key discovery.

**Assessment:**
- **Risk Level:** Low for most applications
- **Attack Vector:** Requires ability to precisely time cryptographic operations
- **Affected Operations:** ECDSA signatures, key generation, ECDH
- **NOT Affected:** ECDSA signature verification
- **Upstream Status:** Project considers side-channel attacks out of scope; no planned fix

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immediate Action:** ✅ **ACCEPTED RISK** (Low likelihood in typical web application)
   - Attack requires local access or precise network timing
   - Your backend uses JWTs for authentication (signature verification only)
   - Risk is minimal for typical deployment scenarios

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Monitor for updates to `python-jose` that might use alternative crypto libraries
   - Consider migrating to `PyJWT` library (alternative JWT implementation)
   - Document this known issue in your security documentation
   - Re-audit after any authentication library updates

3. **Mitigation (if high security required):**
   - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (already done via `slowapi`)
   - Use network-level protections (TLS, VPN) to prevent timing analysis
   - Consider using hardware security modules (HSM) for key operations

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (For You!)

### Option 1: One-Command Automated Audit (RECOMMENDED)

The easiest way to run a complete security audit:

```bash
cd backend/pypi-mirror
./scripts/quick-audit.sh
```

This will:
1. ✅ Download all packages to the mirror (if not already done)
2. ✅ Start the mirror server
3. ✅ Install pip-audit from the mirror
4. ✅ Scan all backend dependencies
5. ✅ Generate a detailed report
6. ✅ Show you the results

**Expected Output:**
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Running Quick Audits

Anytime you want to check for new vulnerabilities:
```bash
cd backend/pypi-mirror
./scripts/quick-audit.sh --no-download  # Uses existing mirror
```

### Tip 2: Viewing Past Reports

All audit reports are saved with timestamps:
```bash
ls -lt backend/security-audit-*.txt
cat backend/security-audit-20251024-*.txt
```

### Tip 3: Updating the Mirror

To get the latest versions of packages:
```bash
cd backend/pypi-mirror
rm -rf simple/               # Remove old packages
./scripts/download-packages.sh  # Download latest
