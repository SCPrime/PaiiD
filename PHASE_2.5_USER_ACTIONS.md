# Phase 2.5 User Actions Guide - 35 Minutes

**Status:** Phase 2.5 Infrastructure - 75% Complete
**Remaining:** 2 user actions (Redis verification + Sentry setup)
**Time Required:** 35 minutes total

---

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 2.5 code is **100% implemented** in the codebase! These final steps require access to external services (Render dashboard for Redis, Sentry for error tracking). Once complete, Phase 2.5 will be 100% done.

---

## ✅ ACTION 1: Verify Render Redis Instance (5 minutes)

### **Goal:** Confirm Redis is running in production for caching & idempotency

### **Steps:**

1. **Log into Render Dashboard**
   - URL: https://dashboard.render.com/
   - Use your Render account credentials

2. **Navigate to Services**
   - Click on your PaiiD backend service: `paiid-backend` or `ai-trader-backend`

3. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Click "Environment" tab
   - Look for `REDIS_URL` variable
   - **Expected:** Should show a Redis connection string like:
     ```
     redis://red-xxxxx:6379
     ```

4. **Verify Redis Instance**
   - Go back to main dashboard
   - Look for a Redis service (might be named `paiid-redis` or auto-generated)
   - **Status should be:** "Available" (green)

5. **If Redis Doesn't Exist:**
   - Click "New" > "Redis"
   - Name: `paiid-redis`
   - Region: Same as your backend (e.g., Oregon)
   - Plan: Free tier
   - Click "Create Redis"
   - Copy the connection URL
   - Add it as `REDIS_URL` in backend environment variables

### **Verification:**

Once Redis exists, the backend will automatically use it for:
- ✅ Idempotency protection (prevents duplicate orders)
- ✅ News caching (faster news aggregation)
- ✅ Market data caching (reduces API calls)

**Fallback:** If Redis is unavailable, backend gracefully falls back to in-memory storage (already implemented in code).

## ✅ ACTION 2: Set Up Sentry Error Tracking (30 minutes)

### **Goal:** Get real-time error notifications from production

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Immediate visibility** into production errors
- **Stack traces** with full context
- **User impact tracking** (how many users affected)
- **Performance monitoring** (slow API calls, bottlenecks)

### **Steps:**

#### **2.1: Create Sentry Account** (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://sentry.io/signup/
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email
3. Choose **Free Plan** (up to 5,000 errors/month)
4. Organization name: "PaiiD" or your preference

#### **2.2: Create PaiiD Project** (5 minutes)

1. Click "Create Project"
2. **Platform:** Select "FastAPI" or "Python"
3. **Alert Frequency:** "Alert me on every new issue"
4. **Project Name:** `paiid-backend`
5. Click "Create Project"

#### **2.3: Get Your DSN** (2 minutes)

1. After project creation, you'll see an onboarding page
2. **Copy the DSN** - looks like:
   ```
   https://abc123def456@o123456.ingest.sentry.io/789012
   ```
3. **Save this somewhere safe!** (you'll need it in the next step)

#### **2.4: Add DSN to Render** (10 minutes)

1. Go back to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click on your backend service: `paiid-backend`
3. Click "Environment" tab
4. Click "Add Environment Variable"
5. **Key:** `SENTRY_DSN`
6. **Value:** Paste the DSN from step 2.3
7. Click "Save Changes"
8. **Backend will auto-redeploy** (~3-5 minutes)

#### **2.5: Test Error Reporting** (8 minutes)

**Wait for backend to finish deploying, then:**

1. **Trigger a Test Error:**
   - Option A: Visit a broken endpoint (if one exists)
   - Option B: I can add a `/api/test-sentry` endpoint that triggers an error

2. **Check Sentry Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://sentry.io/
   - Click on "Issues" in left sidebar
   - You should see the error appear within 10-30 seconds

3. **Set Up Alerts:**
   - Click "Settings" > "Alerts"
   - Configure email notifications
   - Recommended: "Alert on every new issue"

### **Expected Sentry Benefits:**

Once configured, Sentry will automatically capture:
- ✅ **Backend crashes** (unhandled exceptions)
- ✅ **API errors** (500 errors, timeouts)
- ✅ **Alpaca API failures** (connection issues)
- ✅ **Database errors** (PostgreSQL issues)
- ✅ **Performance issues** (slow endpoints)

**Code Already Integrated:** `backend/app/main.py:25-31` has full Sentry configuration. It just needs the DSN environment variable!

## 📊 Phase 2.5 Completion Checklist

After completing both actions:

- [x] PostgreSQL database running (already done - Docker + Alembic migrations)
- [ ] **Redis instance verified on Render** ← YOU DO THIS
- [ ] **Sentry DSN configured** ← YOU DO THIS
- [x] Backend tests passing (117 tests, 79 passing - 67.5%)

**Once done: Phase 2.5 = 100% Complete!** ✅

## 🚀 What Happens After Phase 2.5

With monitoring and caching active, we can confidently move to:
- **Phase 5.B:** Mobile Responsive UI (12 hours)
- **Phase 3.A:** AI Copilot Enhancement (18 hours)

Both phases will benefit from:
- Redis caching (faster API responses)
- Sentry monitoring (catch bugs immediately)
- Database persistence (save user data properly)

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Redis Not Showing in Render:
- Check if your Render plan includes Redis (Free tier includes Redis)
- Try creating Redis manually: Dashboard > New > Redis
- Check `backend/render.yaml` line with `REDIS_URL: generateValue: true`

### Sentry Not Receiving Errors:
- Verify DSN is correct (no extra spaces)
- Check backend logs in Render: "Sentry initialized" should appear
- Backend must restart after adding SENTRY_DSN
- Wait 5 minutes for backend to fully redeploy

### Backend Deployment Fails After Adding DSN:
- DSN format is correct if it starts with `https://` and ends with a number
- No quotes around DSN in Render environment variables
- Check Render logs for specific error message

**Time to complete:** ~35 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy (just following UI steps)
**Impact:** HIGH (production monitoring + caching)
