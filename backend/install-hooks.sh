# PAIID BACKEND PRE-COMMIT HOOKS INSTALLER
# ====================================
# This script installs pre-commit hooks for the Python backend
#
# Usage:
#   bash install-hooks.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Installs pre-commit package (if not already installed)
#   2. Installs the git hooks from .pre-commit-config.yaml
#   3. Runs hooks on all files to verify setup
#
# Requirements:
#   - Python 3.11+
#   - pip
