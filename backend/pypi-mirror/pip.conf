# PaiiD Internal PyPI Mirror Configuration
#
# This file configures pip to use the internal package mirror
# for pip-audit and its dependencies.
#
# Installation locations (in order of precedence):
#   1. Per-user: ~/.config/pip/pip.conf (Linux/macOS) or %APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini (Windows)
#   2. Global: /etc/pip.conf (Linux/macOS) or C:\ProgramData\pip\pip.ini (Windows)
#   3. Site: <venv>/pip.conf
#
# Or use environment variables:
#   export PIP_INDEX_URL=<mirror-url>
#   export PIP_TRUSTED_HOST=<mirror-host>
#
# For CI/CD environments, prefer environment variables over config files.

[global]
# Primary package index (internal mirror)
# REPLACE THIS URL with your actual internal mirror URL
# Examples:
#   - Local testing: http://localhost:8080/
#   - Artifactory: https://artifactory.company.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-local/simple
#   - Nexus: https://nexus.company.com/repository/pypi-internal/simple
#   - devpi: https://devpi.company.com/root/pypi/+simple/
index-url = http://localhost:8080/

# Fallback to PyPI if package not found in mirror (optional)
# Comment out if you want strict mirror-only installation
extra-index-url = https://pypi.org/simple

# Trusted hosts (no SSL verification)
# Add your internal mirror hostname here if it doesn't have valid SSL
# Remove this line if your mirror has proper SSL certificates
trusted-host = localhost

# Proxy configuration (if required)
# Uncomment and configure if behind a corporate proxy
# proxy = http://proxy.company.com:8080

[install]
# Disable pip version check to reduce external network calls
disable-pip-version-check = true

# Prefer binary packages (wheels) over source distributions
prefer-binary = true
