# JWT Authentication Fix - Summary

## Issue
API token requests were being incorrectly treated as JWT tokens, causing "Invalid token: Not enough segments" errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Auth detection was working correctly** - `get_auth_mode()` properly detected API tokens
2. **JWT decoder was being called anyway** - The API token (no dots, 43 chars) was being passed to JWT decode
3. **Poor error message** - Error wasn't clear about the root cause

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Logging (`backend/app/core/unified_auth.py`)
- Added debug logging to `get_auth_mode()` to track token detection
- Added info logging to `get_current_user_unified()` to show auth flow
- Logs now show:
  - Token preview (first 20 chars for security)
  - Auth mode detection result
  - Which authentication path is taken
  - API token auth success confirmation

### 2. Improved JWT Error Handling (`backend/app/core/jwt.py`)
- Added defensive check for JWT format (must have 2 dots separating 3 segments)
- Improved error messages for common cases:
  - Expired tokens
  - Invalid signatures
  - Malformed JWT structure
- Better user-friendly error messages instead of raw library errors

### 3. Auth Flow Verification
- All routers are using `get_current_user_unified` correctly
- `auth.py` correctly uses `get_current_user` for JWT-only endpoints (logout, profile)
- Test confirmed API token detection works correctly

## Testing
Run the backend with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001` and check logs for:
1. "Auth request - header preview: Bearer tuGlKvrYEo..."
2. "Token matches API_TOKEN - using API_TOKEN auth mode"
3. "Using API token authentication"
4. "API token auth successful - returning user: mvp_user"

## Expected Behavior
- API tokens: Return MVP user (id=1) immediately, no JWT decoding attempted
- JWT tokens: Properly decoded and validated
- Invalid tokens: Clear error messages

## Files Modified
1. `backend/app/core/unified_auth.py` - Enhanced logging
2. `backend/app/core/jwt.py` - Improved error handling

## Next Steps (from plan)
- [ ] Add unit tests for API token and JWT paths
- [ ] Update `api-tests.http` with test cases
- [ ] Test with real backend server
- [ ] Update documentation
