## 🎯 Handoff to ChatGPT

**ChatGPT Executor:**
1. Read each subtask carefully
2. Implement in order (respect dependencies)
3. Run tests after each task
4. Fix any errors immediately
5. Update EXECUTION_LOG.md after each task
6. Mark log "READY FOR REVIEW" when done

**Escalate to Claude if:**
- Architecture decision needed
- Specification is unclear
- Breaking change required
- Security concern discovered

---

**STATUS:** ✅ READY FOR EXECUTION
