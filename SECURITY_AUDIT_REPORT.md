## Executive Summary

### Overall Security Posture: MODERATE RISK

**Total Vulnerabilities Found:** 3 (Backend only)
- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 3
- **Low:** 0

**Frontend Status:** ✅ No vulnerabilities detected (0/1211 packages)

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Upgrade `urllib3` from 1.26.20 to 2.5.0+ (MEDIUM severity - SSRF vulnerability)
2. Monitor `ecdsa` package - vulnerability has no fix available (timing attack)

## Backend Vulnerabilities (3 Found)

### 1. urllib3 - CVE-2025-50181 (MEDIUM Severity)

**Package:** `urllib3` version 1.26.20
**CVE:** CVE-2025-50181
**GHSA:** GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Fixed In:** 2.5.0

#### Description
urllib3 handles redirects and retries using the same mechanism controlled by the `Retry` object. The `retries` parameter passed to `PoolManager()` instantiation is currently ignored, which means attempts to disable redirects at the PoolManager level fail silently.

#### Impact
**SSRF Vulnerability Risk:**
- Applications attempting to mitigate SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the PoolManager level remain vulnerable
- Redirects are often used to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities
- An attacker could potentially redirect requests to internal services or unintended external targets

**Affected Usage:**
```python
# These patterns DO NOT work as intended in urllib3 < 2.5.0:
http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=0)  # Does NOT disable redirects
http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=urllib3.Retry(redirect=0))  # Does NOT work
http = urllib3.PoolManager(retries=False)  # Does NOT disable redirects
```

#### PaiiD Exposure Assessment
**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Reasoning:**
- PaiiD uses `requests` library (which depends on urllib3) for external API calls
- Primary API integrations: Tradier API, Alpaca API, Anthropic API
- All API endpoints are explicitly configured and validated
- No user-provided URLs are used for external requests
- SSRF risk is mitigated by explicit URL construction and validation

**Code Analysis:**
```bash
# Check for urllib3 usage patterns
grep -r "PoolManager" backend/
# Result: No direct PoolManager instantiation found
# urllib3 is only used indirectly through requests library
```

#### Remediation

**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** Within 7 days

**Steps:**
1. Upgrade urllib3 to version 2.5.0 or later:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade "urllib3>=2.5.0"
   ```

2. Update requirements.txt:
   ```diff
   - urllib3==1.26.20
   + urllib3>=2.5.0
   ```

3. Test all external API integrations:
   - Tradier API connections
   - Alpaca API connections
   - Anthropic API connections
   - News feed parsing

4. Verify compatibility with requests library (may need upgrade)

**Workaround (Temporary):**
If immediate upgrade is not possible, explicitly disable redirects at request level:
```python
import requests
response = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=False)
```

### 2. ecdsa - CVE-2024-23342 (MEDIUM Severity)

**Package:** `ecdsa` version 0.19.1
**CVE:** CVE-2024-23342
**GHSA:** GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Fixed In:** ⚠️ NO FIX AVAILABLE

#### Description
python-ecdsa is subject to a **Minerva timing attack** on the P-256 curve. Using the `ecdsa.SigningKey.sign_digest()` API function, an attacker can use timing analysis of signatures to leak the internal nonce, which may allow for private key discovery.

**Affected Operations:**
- ECDSA signatures ✓
- Key generation ✓
- ECDH operations ✓
- Signature verification ✗ (unaffected)

#### Impact
**Timing Attack Vector:**
- Requires the attacker to:
  1. Control input data being signed
  2. Measure signature generation timing with high precision
  3. Perform statistical analysis over many samples
  4. Derive the internal nonce from timing variations
  5. Use nonce to recover private key

**Attack Feasibility:** LOW
- Requires local access or network timing measurements
- Requires thousands of signature samples
- Requires cryptographic expertise

#### PaiiD Exposure Assessment
**Risk Level:** VERY LOW

**Reasoning:**
- PaiiD uses JWT tokens with HS256 (HMAC-SHA256), NOT ECDSA
- JWT signing uses symmetric key (JWT_SECRET_KEY), not ECDSA
- ecdsa is a transitive dependency, not directly used
- No ECDSA signing operations in application code

**Dependency Chain Analysis:**
```bash
# Find why ecdsa is installed
pip show ecdsa
# Likely pulled in by: python-jose, alpaca-py, or similar JWT/auth library
```

**Code Verification:**
```bash
grep -r "SigningKey" backend/
grep -r "import ecdsa" backend/
# Result: No direct usage of ecdsa library
```

#### Remediation

**Priority:** LOW
**Timeline:** Monitor for updates (no immediate fix available)

**Project Statement:**
The python-ecdsa project considers side channel attacks **out of scope** and there is **no planned fix**.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Accept Risk:** Document as accepted risk (no fix available)
2. **Monitor:** Track ecdsa releases for potential future fixes
3. **Audit:** Verify no direct usage of ecdsa signing operations
4. **Alternative:** If ECDSA is needed in future, consider:
   - `cryptography` library (better maintained, timing-safe)
   - Hardware security modules (HSM)
   - Cloud KMS services (AWS KMS, GCP KMS)

**Mitigation:**
- Continue using HS256 for JWT signing (not affected)
- Avoid introducing ECDSA signing operations
- If ECDSA is required, use `cryptography` library instead

### 3. pip - CVE-2025-8869 (MEDIUM Severity)

**Package:** `pip` version 25.2
**CVE:** CVE-2025-8869
**GHSA:** GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Fixed In:** 25.3 (planned, not yet released)

#### Description
In the fallback extraction path for source distributions (sdist), `pip` uses Python's `tarfile` module without verifying that symbolic/hard link targets resolve inside the intended extraction directory. A malicious sdist can include links that escape the target directory and overwrite arbitrary files during `pip install`.

#### Impact
**Arbitrary File Overwrite:**
- Successful exploitation enables arbitrary file overwrite outside the build/extraction directory
- Can tamper with configuration files or startup scripts
- May lead to code execution depending on environment
- Direct impact: integrity compromise on vulnerable system

**Attack Vector:**
- Install attacker-controlled sdist from malicious index or URL
- Triggered during `pip install` of compromised package
- No special privileges required
- Requires active user action (installing malicious package)

#### PaiiD Exposure Assessment
**Risk Level:** LOW

**Reasoning:**
- PaiiD uses production dependencies from trusted sources (PyPI)
- `requirements.txt` pins specific versions
- No dynamic package installation from user input
- Deployment uses Docker with pre-built images
- CI/CD pipeline controls package installation

**Attack Prerequisites:**
1. Attacker must compromise PyPI package or internal package index
2. Developer must install compromised package
3. Extraction must use fallback path (rare)

#### Remediation

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Timeline:** Upgrade when pip 25.3 is released

**Monitoring:**
- Track pip releases: https://github.com/pypa/pip/releases
- Subscribe to security advisories: https://github.com/pypa/pip/security/advisories

**Temporary Mitigation:**
1. **Defense in Depth - PEP 706:**
   - Use Python 3.12+ which implements safe-extraction behavior
   - Current Python version: Check with `python --version`

2. **Package Source Control:**
   - Only install packages from trusted sources (official PyPI)
   - Review `requirements.txt` changes in code review
   - Use dependency scanning in CI/CD (Dependabot, Snyk)

3. **Least Privilege:**
   - Run pip install with minimal privileges
   - Use virtual environments (already implemented)
   - Docker containers limit blast radius

**When pip 25.3 is released:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade "pip>=25.3"
```
