# JWT Authentication Rollback

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ROLLED BACK - Simple API Token Authentication Restored
**Commit**: `7b62dcb`

---

## What Happened

After implementing JWT authentication (commits `a6b29ba` and `d3d7905`), the frontend deployment on Render failed repeatedly. This prevented users from accessing the application at all, including the login screen.

## Decision

Rolled back the JWT authentication system to restore simple API token authentication and unblock testing of the Tradier API integration.

## Reverted Changes

### Files Deleted:
- ❌ `frontend/components/LoginForm.tsx` - Login/register UI component
- ❌ `frontend/lib/auth.ts` - JWT authentication utilities

### Files Restored:
- ✅ `frontend/pages/index.tsx` - No authentication gate, direct dashboard access
- ✅ `frontend/pages/api/proxy/[...path].ts` - Uses simple `API_TOKEN` again
- ✅ `frontend/next.config.js` - Removed ESLint ignore flag

## Current State

**Authentication Method**: Simple API Token
**User Access**: Direct dashboard access (no login required)
**Backend API Token**: `rnd_bDRqi1TvLvd3rC78yvUSgDraH2Kl`
**Tradier API Key**: `fbvCD3YvHQCfIiU0TLH0FYj71Oni` (updated on Render)

## Frontend Deployment

The rollback has been pushed to `main` branch and should trigger automatic deployment on Render.

**Deployment URL**: https://paiid-frontend.onrender.com

Once deployed, users should:
1. Clear browser localStorage (to remove any stale JWT tokens)
2. Refresh the page
3. See the dashboard directly without login screen

## Next Steps

1. **Verify deployment succeeded** on Render
2. **Test Tradier API integration** - click through all 10 radial menu wedges
3. **Confirm live data loads** in each wedge
4. **Plan proper authentication** implementation after confirming base functionality works

## Why Rollback?

The JWT authentication system was technically sound, but deployment failures blocked all testing. By restoring the working state, we can:

1. Verify Tradier API integration works correctly
2. Test all 10 workflow wedges with live data
3. Identify any other issues unrelated to authentication
4. Plan authentication implementation more carefully

## Future Authentication Plan

When we're ready to implement proper authentication:

1. **Test locally first** - Ensure `npm run build` succeeds before pushing
2. **Fix ESLint errors** - Don't bypass, fix properly
3. **Test Docker build** - Ensure Dockerfile works locally
4. **Gradual rollout** - Deploy to staging environment first
5. **User communication** - Inform users before requiring login

## Files for Reference

The JWT implementation is documented in:
- `JWT_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `LOGOUT.html` - Helper to clear localStorage
- `clear-auth.html` - Alternative logout helper

These files remain in the repo for future reference but are not currently active.

**Status**: Deployment in progress on Render
**ETA**: 3-5 minutes for frontend redeployment
**Next Action**: Verify deployment and test Tradier integration
