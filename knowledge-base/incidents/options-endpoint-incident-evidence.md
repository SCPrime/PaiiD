## üîç Before ‚Äì Failure Evidence
- `BUG_REPORT_OPTIONS_500.md` captured the original 500 responses from `/api/expirations/{symbol}` along with successful direct Tradier calls, confirming the backend handler was the failure point.„ÄêF:BUG_REPORT_OPTIONS_500.md‚Ä†L10-L40„Äë
- The dedicated diagnostic script (`test_options_endpoint.py`) reproduced the failure locally, showing `Status: 500` for the unauthenticated and authenticated paths while the upstream Tradier request succeeded.„ÄêF:test_options_endpoint.py‚Ä†L6-L42„Äë

```
==== TEST 2: Expirations Endpoint (No Auth) ====
Status: 500
Response: {"detail":"Not authenticated"}

## ‚úÖ After ‚Äì Success Evidence
- Manual verification now returns populated expirations and full chains via the proxy using the corrected `/api/options/...` routes.„ÄêF:OPTIONS_TRADING_COMPLETE.md‚Ä†L120-L170„Äë
- The Playwright regression suite exercises modal loading, table rendering, and filter toggles using resilient selectors, ensuring the UI reflects backend success and exposes any regression in future runs.„ÄêF:frontend/tests/options-chain.spec.ts‚Ä†L1-L214„Äë
- Playwright configuration stores HTML reports, screenshots, and videos on failure, making visual evidence available for retrospective reviews (`frontend/playwright-report/` after each run).„ÄêF:frontend/playwright.config.ts‚Ä†L1-L57„Äë
