# üîí LOCKED REFERENCE FOLDER - DO NOT MODIFY

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL DEVELOPERS AND AI ASSISTANTS

**This folder contains the FINAL, LOCKED versions of:**
1. The iPi symbol (œÄ with 2 dots)
2. The complete PaiiD logo
3. The PaiiD Chat Box modal (v46 interface)

## üö´ RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:

1. **READ-ONLY**: These files are REFERENCE ONLY
2. **DO NOT MODIFY**: Never change, refactor, or "improve" these files
3. **COPY ONLY**: When implementing, COPY the code - don't reference it
4. **NO REFORMATTING**: Don't adjust spacing, styling, or structure
5. **SOURCE OF TRUTH**: These are the definitive versions

## üìã File Inventory:

### 1. `1-iPi-Symbol-Locked.svg`
- The œÄ symbol with 2 dots (left and right)
- Used in all PaiiD branding
- Exact spacing and positioning

### 2. `2-CompletePaiiDLogo-Locked.tsx`
- Full "PaiiD" logo with œÄ symbol
- Subtitle lines
- Exact colors and gradients

### 3. `3-PaiiDLogo-Spaced-Reference.tsx`
- Logo with proper letter spacing
- Shows how "P", "a", "œÄ", "D" are arranged
- Includes all size variants (xs, small, medium, large, xlarge)

### 4. `4-PaiiDChatBoxLocked.tsx`
- The v46 interface modal
- "PaiiD Interface" header
- 5 capabilities list
- "Ask PaiiD" input field
- Slide-up animation
- Exact styling from screenshot

## üéØ How to Use These Files:

**WHEN IMPLEMENTING:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Copy the code
import { PaiiDLogoLocked } from '../LOCKED FINAL iPi Wrapped Logo and PaiiD Chat Box/2-CompletePaiiDLogo-Locked';

// ‚ùå WRONG: Don't modify the locked files
// Don't add props, don't change colors, don't "refactor"
```

**WHEN IN DOUBT:**
- Check these files first
- Copy exactly as-is
- Ask the user before deviating
