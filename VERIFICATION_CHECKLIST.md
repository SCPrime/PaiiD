## üß™ VERIFICATION STEPS (After Build Completes)

### Step 1: Check New Build ID

**Command:**
```bash
curl -s https://ai-trader-snowy.vercel.app | grep -o 'buildId":"[^"]*"'
```

**Expected:**
```
buildId":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

```

**Expected Result:**
```

```

**If you see:** `127.0.0.1:8001` ‚Üí ‚ùå Environment variables didn't work, need to investigate

**If empty:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS! No localhost in bundle!

---

### Step 3: Check Bundle for Production URL (Should Show URL)

```
ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com
ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com
```

**Should see:** Multiple occurrences of the production URL

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING (If Checks Fail)

### If Bundle Still Has Localhost:

**Possible Causes:**
1. Environment variables not saved properly
2. Build used cache despite unchecking
3. Wrong environment selected (preview vs production)

**Actions:**
1. Double-check Vercel dashboard env vars are there
2. Try deleting deployment and redeploying
3. Check that vars are set for "Production" environment

### If Browser Still Shows Errors:

**Possible Causes:**
1. Browser cache serving old JavaScript
2. Service worker caching old version
3. CDN cache not invalidated

**Actions:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Wait 5 minutes for CDN to propagate

---
