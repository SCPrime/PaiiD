## ⚠️ CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### Conflict 1: Options Trading vs P&L Dashboard Priority

**ROADMAP.md says:**
- Priority 1: P&L Dashboard (High Priority)
- Priority 2: News Review (High Priority)
- No mention of Options Trading

**PHASE_0_AUDIT_REPORT.md says:**
- Phase 1: Options Trading Implementation (6-8 hours)
- P&L Dashboard not mentioned in immediate phases

**RESOLUTION:**
- ✅ **Follow PHASE_0_AUDIT_REPORT.md** (more recent, Oct 20 vs general roadmap)
- Options Trading is Phase 1 priority
- P&L Dashboard deferred to ROADMAP.md long-term plan
- ROADMAP.md execution starts AFTER Phase 0-4 completion

### Conflict 2: Timeline Discrepancy

**ROADMAP.md:**
- 80 days total (11 + 14 + 17 + 17 + 21)
- Full-featured implementations

**PHASE_0_AUDIT_REPORT.md:**
- 24-32 hours total (1-2 + 3-4 + 4-5 + 6-8 days)
- MVP/essential features only

**RESOLUTION:**
- Phase 0 is MVP foundation
- ROADMAP is comprehensive enhancement
- Execute Phase 0 first, then ROADMAP features

### Conflict 3: Allessandra Strategy System

**PaiiD_IMPLEMENTATION.md says:**
- 174 hours implementation
- 8 phases of development

**Current Reality:**
- System deleted Oct 21, 2025
- All files removed (commit bf7f0df)

**RESOLUTION:**
- ❌ Ignore all Allessandra TODOs
- System is defunct
- No implementation required

## 🚨 CRITICAL DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Phase 0 vs ROADMAP Priority
**Question:** Should we implement P&L Dashboard (ROADMAP priority 1) or Options Trading (Phase 0 priority 1) first?

**Answer:** ✅ **Options Trading (Phase 0)**

**Rationale:**
- Phase 0 audit is more recent (Oct 20 vs general roadmap)
- Options trading unlocks more advanced strategies
- P&L Dashboard partially implemented already
- Code quality improvements needed before adding features

### Decision 2: Allessandra System
**Question:** Should we implement the 174-hour Allessandra system?

**Answer:** ❌ **No - System Deleted**

**Rationale:**
- System deleted Oct 21, 2025 (commit bf7f0df)
- All files removed (10 files, 2,057 lines)
- No references in current codebase
- User explicitly requested deletion

### Decision 3: Scheduler Integration Timing
**Question:** When should we integrate the scheduler?

**Answer:** ✅ **Parallel with Phase 0 (anytime)**

**Rationale:**
- Already deployed (Oct 7, 2025)
- Independent of Phase 0 work
- Can be tested/integrated while Phase 0 progresses
- No blocking dependencies
