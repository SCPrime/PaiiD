# Storyboard Canvas User Guide

## Overview

The Storyboard Canvas is a powerful UI refinement tool that allows you to capture screenshots of your PaiiD dashboard, annotate them with feedback and design ideas, and export/share your mockups with your team.

**Think of it as your visual sketchpad for UI improvements** - no design tools required!

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl + Shift + S** | Open Storyboard Canvas |
| **Ctrl + Z** | Undo last annotation |
| **Escape** | Close Storyboard Canvas |
| **Enter** | Confirm text annotation |

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Version Titles
‚ùå Bad: "Version 1", "Screenshot 2"
‚úÖ Good: "Radial Menu - Hover States", "Trade Form - Mobile Layout"

### 2. Combine Tools for Clarity
- Use **arrows** to point + **text** to explain
- Use **highlights** to categorize + **boxes** to group
- Example: Highlight problem areas in red, then add text notes explaining the issue

### 3. Save Versions Frequently
- Save after each major round of annotations
- Think of versions like Git commits - small, focused changes
- Easier to compare "before" and "after" when you have granular versions

### 4. Color Code Your Feedback
Establish a color convention with your team:
- Red = Must fix (bugs, critical UX issues)
- Orange = Should fix (nice-to-have improvements)
- Green = Keep/highlight good design
- Blue = Questions or discussion points
- Purple = New feature ideas
- Pink = Visual/design polish

### 5. Export Before Major Changes
- Export to PNG/PDF before deploying changes
- Keeps a record of "what we were thinking" for future reference
- Useful for design documentation

## Tips & Tricks

### Draggable Floating Button
- The üìã button can be dragged to any corner of your screen
- Hover for a pulse effect
- Position it where it won't block important UI

### Text Annotation Tips
- Keep text concise (1-2 sentences max)
- Use ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Use emojis for quick visual cues (‚ö†Ô∏è üé® üîß üí°)

### When to Use Each Tool
- **Arrow**: "This goes here", "User clicks this"
- **Box**: "This whole section needs work", "Add component here"
- **Text**: Detailed explanations, questions, specifications
- **Highlight**: "Focus on this area", "This is good/bad"

### Working with Multiple Annotations
- Add annotations in order (1, 2, 3...) to show sequence
- Use consistent colors for related feedback
- Group annotations spatially (all feedback on header in one area)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Screenshot Capture Fails
- **Issue**: Black screen or error message
- **Solution**: Ensure browser has screenshot permissions
- **Workaround**: Use built-in OS screenshot tool, then paste into image editor

### Annotations Not Appearing
- **Issue**: Click/drag doesn't create annotation
- **Solution**: Ensure you've selected a tool (not "Select" mode)
- **Check**: Look for highlighted tool button

### Versions Not Saving
- **Issue**: "Save Current State" doesn't work
- **Solution**: Check browser localStorage isn't full
- **Workaround**: Export PNG/PDF instead, delete old versions

### Floating Button Not Visible
- **Issue**: Can't find the üìã button
- **Solution**: Look in bottom-right corner, it may be dragged off-screen
- **Workaround**: Use Ctrl+Shift+S hotkey instead

### Can't Drag Floating Button
- **Issue**: Button won't move
- **Solution**: Click and hold (don't just click)
- **Note**: Button becomes semi-transparent when dragging
