## Backend Enhancements (Render)

### Service Details
- **Service:** paiid-backend
- **URL:** https://paiid-backend.onrender.com
- **Status:** ✅ Live and operational
- **Build Time:** ~3 minutes
- **Deployment Method:** Auto-deploy from `main` branch

### New Features

#### 1. Technical Indicators Service (`technical_indicators.py`)
**File:** `backend/app/services/technical_indicators.py` (345 lines)
**Status:** ✅ Operational

**Core Indicators Implemented:**

1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
   - Period: 14 (configurable)
   - Returns: 0-100 scale
   - Logic: Calculates average gains vs losses over period
   - Signals: <30 oversold (bullish), >70 overbought (bearish)

2. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
   - Fast EMA: 12, Slow EMA: 26, Signal: 9
   - Returns: macd line, signal line, histogram
   - Logic: Fast EMA - Slow EMA, with signal line crossover detection
   - Signals: Histogram > 0 bullish, < 0 bearish

3. **Bollinger Bands**
   - Period: 20, Std Dev: 2.0
   - Returns: upper, middle (SMA), lower bands
   - Logic: SMA ± (std_dev × standard deviation)
   - Signals: Price < lower (bullish), price > upper (bearish)

4. **Moving Averages**
   - SMA 20, SMA 50, SMA 200, EMA 12
   - Golden Cross: 50-day > 200-day (bullish)
   - Death Cross: 50-day < 200-day (bearish)
   - Price position relative to MAs indicates trend strength

5. **Trend Analysis (Linear Regression)**
   - Analyzes last 20 price points
   - Calculates slope for trend direction
   - Returns: direction (bullish/bearish/neutral), strength (0-1)
   - Identifies support (min of last 10) and resistance (max of last 10)

**Signal Generation Algorithm:**

```python
def generate_signal(symbol, prices, volumes=None):
    """
    Scoring System:
    - Evaluates 5 technical indicators
    - Accumulates bullish_score and bearish_score
    - Generates BUY/SELL/HOLD action based on scores
    - Confidence: 50 + (winning_score / total_score * 50)
    - Entry/exit prices calculated from Bollinger Bands and support/resistance
    - Risk/reward ratio: (take_profit - entry) / (entry - stop_loss)
    """
```

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- RSI oversold (<30): +2 bullish
- RSI overbought (>70): +2 bearish
- MACD bullish crossover: +1 bullish
- Price < lower Bollinger Band: +1 bullish
- Price > upper Bollinger Band: +1 bearish
- Golden cross (SMA50 > SMA200): +1 bullish
- Death cross (SMA50 < SMA200): +1 bearish
- Price above 20-day MA: +1 bullish
- Bullish trend: +trend_strength * 2
- Bearish trend: +trend_strength * 2

#### 2. Enhanced AI Router (`ai.py`)
**File:** `backend/app/routers/ai.py` (276 lines)
**Status:** ✅ Enhanced with new endpoint

- `min_confidence`: Float 0-100 (default: 60.0)
- `use_technical`: Boolean (default: true)

**Enhanced Recommendation Model:**
```python
class Recommendation(BaseModel):
    # Existing fields
    symbol: str
    action: Literal["BUY", "SELL", "HOLD"]
    confidence: float
    reason: str
    targetPrice: float

## Comparison: Stage 2 vs Stage 3

| Metric | Stage 2 (News Review) | Stage 3 (AI Recommendations) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **New Endpoints** | 3 | 1 (but comprehensive) |
| **Frontend Components** | 1 enhanced | 1 major enhancement |
| **Lines of Code Added** | ~550 | ~830 |
| **Build Time** | ~5 min | ~5 min |
| **Response Time** | <400ms | <520ms (more computation) |
| **New Services** | news_cache.py | technical_indicators.py |
| **UI Complexity** | Medium | High (expandable panels) |
| **Data Processing** | Filtering/aggregation | Real-time calculations |

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Simulated Price Data
**Issue:** Currently using generated price data (200-day simulated trend + noise)
**Impact:** Signals are realistic but not based on actual market prices
**Status:** TODO for Stage 4 or later
**Future:** Integrate Tradier API historical bars endpoint

### 2. No Volume Analysis
**Issue:** `volumes` parameter accepted but not used
**Impact:** Missing volume-based indicators (OBV, volume spikes)
**Status:** Acceptable for MVP
**Future:** Add volume indicators: OBV, volume MA, volume breakouts

### 3. Execute Signal Not Integrated
**Issue:** "Execute Signal" button shows alert, doesn't pre-fill Execute Trade form
**Impact:** User must manually copy values
**Status:** Planned for Stage 4 integration
**Future:** Pass signal data to Execute Trade workflow via state/URL params

### 4. No Historical Signal Tracking
**Issue:** No database storage of past signals
**Impact:** Can't measure signal accuracy over time
**Status:** Not critical for MVP
**Future:** Store signals in database for performance tracking

## Technical Deep Dive

### Signal Generation Flow

```
1. User clicks "Generate Recommendations" with Technical Analysis enabled
   ↓
2. Frontend: fetch("/api/proxy/ai/signals?use_technical=true&min_confidence=60")
   ↓
3. Proxy: Forward to paiid-backend.onrender.com/api/ai/signals
   ↓
4. Backend: Parse symbols (default: AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,META,AMZN,NVDA,TSLA,SPY,QQQ)
   ↓
5. For each symbol:
   a. Generate 200 days of simulated price data (TODO: replace with Tradier)
   b. Call TechnicalIndicators.generate_signal(symbol, prices)
      i. Calculate RSI (14-period)
      ii. Calculate MACD (12/26/9)
      iii. Calculate Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2σ)
      iv. Calculate MAs (SMA20, SMA50, SMA200, EMA12)
      v. Analyze trend (linear regression on last 20 days)
      vi. Score indicators → bullish_score vs bearish_score
      vii. Determine action: BUY if bullish > bearish, SELL if bearish > bullish, else HOLD
      viii. Calculate confidence: 50 + (winning_score / total_score * 50)
      ix. Calculate entry/exit prices from Bollinger Bands and support/resistance
      x. Calculate risk/reward ratio
   c. Filter: Keep only if confidence >= min_confidence (60)
   ↓
6. Return recommendations (max 5) + metadata
   ↓
7. Frontend: Render cards with expandable details
```

### Risk Classification Algorithm

```python
if confidence >= 80:
    risk = "Low"
elif confidence >= 65:
    risk = "Medium"
else:
    risk = "High"
```

### Entry/Exit Price Calculation

**For BUY signals:**
```python
entry_price = current_price * 0.998  # Slight discount (0.2%)
stop_loss = max(bollinger_lower, trend_support)
take_profit = min(bollinger_upper, trend_resistance)
```

**For SELL signals:**
```python
entry_price = current_price * 1.002  # Slight premium (0.2%)
stop_loss = min(bollinger_upper, trend_resistance)
take_profit = max(bollinger_lower, trend_support)
```

## Appendix: Technical Indicator Formulas

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
```
Changes = [price[i] - price[i-1] for i in 1..n]
Gains = [max(change, 0) for change in Changes]
Losses = [abs(min(change, 0)) for change in Changes]
AvgGain = sum(Gains[-14:]) / 14
AvgLoss = sum(Losses[-14:]) / 14
RS = AvgGain / AvgLoss
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
```

### MACD
```
EMA_fast = EMA(prices, 12)
EMA_slow = EMA(prices, 26)
MACD_line = EMA_fast - EMA_slow
Signal_line = EMA(MACD_line, 9)  # Simplified: MACD * 0.9
Histogram = MACD_line - Signal_line
```

### Bollinger Bands
```
SMA = sum(prices[-20:]) / 20
Variance = sum((p - SMA)^2 for p in prices[-20:]) / 20
StdDev = sqrt(Variance)
Upper = SMA + (2 × StdDev)
Middle = SMA
Lower = SMA - (2 × StdDev)
```

### EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
```
Multiplier = 2 / (period + 1)
EMA[0] = SMA(prices[:period])
EMA[i] = (price[i] × Multiplier) + (EMA[i-1] × (1 - Multiplier))
```

### Trend Analysis (Linear Regression)
```
X = [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]  # Time indices
Y = prices[-20:]  # Last 20 prices
Slope = (n × Σ(XY) - Σ(X) × Σ(Y)) / (n × Σ(X²) - (Σ(X))²)

Direction =
  - "bullish" if Slope > 0.1
  - "bearish" if Slope < -0.1
  - "neutral" otherwise

Strength = min(abs(Slope) / current_price × 1000, 1.0)
Support = min(prices[-10:])
Resistance = max(prices[-10:])
```
