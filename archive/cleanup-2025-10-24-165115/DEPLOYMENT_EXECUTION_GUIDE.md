# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION GUIDE

**Your System:** Windows with PowerShell Core 7.5.3 ‚úÖ

---

## ‚úÖ PREREQUISITES MET

You already have everything you need:
- ‚úÖ PowerShell Core 7.5.3 installed
- ‚úÖ All deployment scripts present:
  - `deploy-production.ps1`
  - `rollback-production.ps1`
  - `test-production.ps1`
- ‚úÖ Git configured
- ‚úÖ Repository at: `C:\Users\SSaint-Cyr\Documents\GitHub\PaiiD`

---

## üéØ OPTION 1: DRY RUN (Test Without Deploying)

Before deploying to production, test the scripts work correctly:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd C:\Users\SSaint-Cyr\Documents\GitHub\PaiiD

# Run test suite against CURRENT production
pwsh -File test-production.ps1

# Expected output:
# - Tests run against https://paiid-backend.onrender.com
# - Shows which endpoints are working
# - Generates test-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
```

**This is SAFE** - it only reads from production, doesn't make changes.

---

## üöÄ OPTION 2: FULL PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

### Step 1: Set Up Render API Key (One-Time Setup)

```powershell
# Get API key from: https://dashboard.render.com/u/settings#api-keys
# Then set environment variable:
$env:RENDER_API_KEY = "rnd-xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Replace with your actual key
```

### Step 2: Get Service IDs (One-Time Setup)

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your **backend service**
3. Copy the ID from URL: `https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-XXXXXXXXXXXXX`
4. Repeat for **frontend service**

```powershell
# Set service IDs
$BackendServiceId = "srv-backend-id-here"
$FrontendServiceId = "srv-frontend-id-here"
```

### Step 3: Run Deployment

```powershell
# Full automated deployment with all checks
pwsh -File deploy-production.ps1 `
  -BackendServiceId $BackendServiceId `
  -FrontendServiceId $FrontendServiceId
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Checks you're on main branch
2. ‚úÖ Pulls latest code
3. ‚úÖ Runs pre-deployment tests
4. ‚úÖ Creates version tag (you'll be prompted for version number)
5. ‚úÖ Validates render.yaml
6. ‚úÖ Triggers Render deployment via API
7. ‚úÖ Waits for deployment to complete
8. ‚úÖ Runs health checks with retries
9. ‚úÖ Runs smoke tests
10. ‚úÖ Generates deployment report

**Duration:** ~10-15 minutes

---

## üß™ OPTION 3: MANUAL DEPLOYMENT + AUTOMATED TESTING

If you don't have Render API key, you can deploy manually and test automatically:

### Step 1: Deploy Manually

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select backend service ‚Üí "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
3. Select frontend service ‚Üí "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployments to complete (~5-10 minutes)

### Step 2: Run Automated Tests

```powershell
# Test the deployed services
pwsh -File test-production.ps1
```

### Step 3: Review Results

```powershell
# Open the generated report
Get-Content test-report-*.md | Select-Object -Last 1
```

---

## üîÑ EMERGENCY ROLLBACK

If something goes wrong after deployment:

```powershell
# Rollback to previous version
pwsh -File rollback-production.ps1 `
  -CurrentTag "v1.0.5" `
  -PreviousTag "v1.0.4"

# Type "ROLLBACK" when prompted to confirm
```

---

## üìä HEALTH CHECK COMMANDS (Manual)

If you prefer manual verification:

```powershell
# Check backend health
curl https://paiid-backend.onrender.com/api/health

# Check frontend
curl https://paiid-frontend.onrender.com

# Check API docs
curl https://paiid-backend.onrender.com/api/docs
```

Expected responses: All should return **HTTP 200**

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "deploy-production.ps1 cannot be loaded"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Unblock the script
Unblock-File deploy-production.ps1
Unblock-File test-production.ps1
Unblock-File rollback-production.ps1
```

### Issue: "Execution of scripts is disabled"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check current policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# If it's "Restricted", change to RemoteSigned
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Issue: "RENDER_API_KEY not set"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Set the API key
$env:RENDER_API_KEY = "rnd-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Or run script without API key (manual deployment mode)
pwsh -File deploy-production.ps1
# It will guide you through manual deployment steps
```

### Issue: "Tests failing with connection errors"

**Cause:** Render free tier services sleep after inactivity

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Wake up services first
curl https://paiid-backend.onrender.com/api/health
curl https://paiid-frontend.onrender.com

# Wait 2-3 minutes for services to fully wake up
Start-Sleep -Seconds 180

# Then run tests
pwsh -File test-production.ps1
```

## üìù EXAMPLE: COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT SESSION

Here's a full example of deploying with API key:

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\SSaint-Cyr\Documents\GitHub\PaiiD

# 2. Set API credentials (replace with your actual values)
$env:RENDER_API_KEY = "rnd-your-key-here"
$BackendServiceId = "srv-your-backend-id"
$FrontendServiceId = "srv-your-frontend-id"

# 3. Run deployment
pwsh -File deploy-production.ps1 `
  -BackendServiceId $BackendServiceId `
  -FrontendServiceId $FrontendServiceId

# You'll be prompted:
# - "Enter new version": Type 1.0.1 (or your version number)
# - Script will run all checks automatically

# 4. Wait for completion (10-15 minutes)

# 5. Review deployment report
Get-Content deployment-report-*.md | Select-Object -Last 1

# 6. Run post-deployment tests (optional)
pwsh -File test-production.ps1

# 7. Monitor production
# Keep terminal open for 15-30 minutes
# Watch for errors in Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
```

## üéØ RECOMMENDED FIRST RUN

Since you're running this for the first time, I recommend:

### Option A: Test Only (Safest)
```powershell
pwsh -File test-production.ps1
```
- ‚úÖ No changes to production
- ‚úÖ Shows what's working/broken
- ‚úÖ Generates report

### Option B: Deploy Without Tests (Fastest)
```powershell
pwsh -File deploy-production.ps1 -SkipTests
```
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skips pre-deployment tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use only if you've already tested manually

### Option C: Full Deployment (Recommended)
```powershell
pwsh -File deploy-production.ps1 `
  -BackendServiceId "srv-xxx" `
  -FrontendServiceId "srv-yyy"
```
- ‚úÖ Complete validation
- ‚úÖ Automated deployment
- ‚úÖ Full reporting

---

## üîí SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

1. **Never commit API keys:**
   ```powershell
   # GOOD: Set in session only
   $env:RENDER_API_KEY = "rnd-xxx"

   # BAD: Don't add to scripts or commit
   ```

2. **Store keys securely:**
   ```powershell
   # Use Windows Credential Manager or 1Password
   # Or set permanently (but securely):
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('RENDER_API_KEY', 'rnd-xxx', 'User')
   ```

3. **Review deployment reports:**
   - Never share reports publicly (they contain URLs, IDs)
   - Review before committing to version control
   - Redact sensitive information if sharing

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CHECKLIST

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Backend health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] Frontend loads successfully
- [ ] Deployment report shows all tests passed
- [ ] No errors in Render logs
- [ ] All 10 workflows load correctly
- [ ] Market data updates in real-time
- [ ] Position tracking works
- [ ] Order execution functions (paper trading)

## üÜò GETTING HELP

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the deployment report:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content deployment-report-*.md | Select-Object -Last 1
   ```

2. **Check Render logs:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.render.com
   - Select service ‚Üí "Logs" tab
   - Look for errors during deployment

3. **Run diagnostics:**
   ```powershell
   # Test health endpoints
   curl https://paiid-backend.onrender.com/api/health

   # Check service status
   curl https://paiid-backend.onrender.com/api/docs
   ```

4. **Review audit reports:**
   - `COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
   - `QUICK_FIXES.md`
   - `ISSUE_TRACKER.md`

---

## üìû NEXT STEPS

**Before deploying:**
1. Review `COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
2. Consider fixing 12 P0 critical issues first
3. Run `test-production.ps1` to see current status

**After deploying:**
1. Monitor logs for 30 minutes
2. Test all 10 workflow stages
3. Verify real-time data updates
4. Check error rates and response times

---

**Your system is ready! You can start with:**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\SSaint-Cyr\Documents\GitHub\PaiiD
pwsh -File test-production.ps1
```

This will show you the current state of production without making any changes.
