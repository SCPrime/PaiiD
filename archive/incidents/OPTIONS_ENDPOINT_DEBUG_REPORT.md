# Options Endpoint Incident Debug Report

**Incident Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Resolved and archived  
**Scope:** Frontend proxy → FastAPI options endpoints → Playwright E2E suite

---

## 🚨 Summary
Requests to `/api/proxy/options/*` returned HTTP 500 responses while validating the Phase 1 options trading workflow. The investigation confirmed mismatched route prefixes between the Next.js proxy and the FastAPI router, incomplete proxy allow-list coverage, and brittle Playwright selectors that failed to exercise the error state. The fixes below were executed sequentially (Phases 1–5) and the root-cause analysis captured in Phase 6.

## 🛠️ Phase-Based Remediation

### Phase 1 – Route correction
- Restored a shared `/api/options/...` contract by loading options data through the proxy instead of the legacy direct paths.  
- Frontend requests now use `/api/proxy/options/expirations/${symbol}` and `/api/proxy/options/chain/${symbol}` (OptionsChain component), matching the FastAPI router that exposes `/options/expirations/{symbol}` and `/options/chains/{symbol}` under the `/api` prefix.【F:frontend/components/trading/OptionsChain.tsx†L87-L124】【F:backend/app/routers/options.py†L18-L115】【F:OPTIONS_TRADING_COMPLETE.md†L120-L165】

### Phase 2 – Proxy allow-list hardening
- Added the options endpoints and dynamic wildcard handling to the proxy allow-list so OPTIONS, GET, and POST requests reach the backend without 405 responses.  
- Enforced explicit origin validation for the Render deployment and local dev hosts, preventing regression to the open debug proxy state.【F:frontend/pages/api/proxy/[...path].ts†L18-L145】

### Phase 3 – Playwright selector updates
- Updated the E2E suite to rely on semantic selectors (`button:has-text(...)`, `h2:has-text(...)`, `tbody tr`) that mirror the rewritten modal markup, ensuring modal, filter, and table assertions target the correct nodes.【F:frontend/tests/options-chain.spec.ts†L1-L132】【F:frontend/tests/options-chain.spec.ts†L169-L214】

### Phase 4 – Error `<div>` handling
- Extended the Playwright regression test to detect the error surface by locating `div:has-text("Error")`, confirming the UI surfaces backend failures gracefully instead of hanging silently.【F:frontend/tests/options-chain.spec.ts†L147-L188】

### Phase 5 – Playwright config enhancements
- Locked in an HTML reporter, CI retries, failure screenshots, retained videos, and an auto-start dev server to make the options-chain suite reproducible on developer laptops and CI.【F:frontend/playwright.config.ts†L1-L44】【F:frontend/playwright.config.ts†L46-L57】

### Phase 6 – Root-cause documentation
- Captured the before/after behaviour, reproduced logs, and remediation summary in the project knowledge base for future retrospectives.  
- The evidence bundle consolidates failing 500 traces and the passing curl/Playwright results referenced by this report.【F:knowledge-base/incidents/options-endpoint-incident-evidence.md†L1-L68】
