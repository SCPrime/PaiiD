# Production Readiness Report

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Agent:** Wave 8 Final Validation
**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT READY - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

## Executive Summary

The PaiiD Trading Platform has undergone comprehensive validation across all critical areas. While the architecture is solid and many components are production-ready, there are **critical issues** in code quality and test coverage that must be addressed before production deployment.

**Overall Assessment:** The system requires remediation in TypeScript compilation errors and test failures before it can be safely deployed to production. Security, documentation, and deployment configurations are generally sound.
