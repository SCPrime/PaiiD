## üìÖ Cron Expression Guide

The scheduler uses cron expressions to define when tasks run:

**Format:** `minute hour day month day_of_week`

**Examples:**
- `0 9 * * 1-5` - 9 AM weekdays
- `0 9,15 * * *` - 9 AM and 3 PM daily
- `*/30 9-16 * * 1-5` - Every 30 min, 9 AM-4 PM weekdays
- `0 10 * * 1` - 10 AM every Monday
- `0 0 1 * *` - Midnight on 1st of every month

**Timezone:**
- Default: `America/New_York` (EST/EDT)
- Market hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET

## üîí Safety Features

### Approval Workflow
When `requires_approval: true`:
1. Schedule runs on time
2. AI generates trade proposal
3. Proposal waits in approval queue
4. You review and approve/reject
5. Trade executes only after approval

### Risk Scoring
Every approval includes:
- **Risk Score:** 0-100 (higher = riskier)
- **AI Confidence:** 0-1 (higher = more confident)
- **Supporting Data:** Technical indicators, news sentiment
- **Expiration:** Approvals expire if not acted upon

### Manual Override
- You can disable any schedule anytime
- You can reject any approval
- You can delete schedules
- No trades execute without your approval

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Schedule Creation Returns 500 Error
**Status:** üîç Under Investigation
**Workaround:** Use API directly or wait for fix
**ETA:** Next deployment

### Issue 2: Scheduler Not Visible in UI
**Fix:** Make sure you're on the Settings wedge
**Location:** Settings ‚Üí Automation tab (may need scrolling)

### Issue 3: Next Run Time Shows Null
**Cause:** Schedule disabled or invalid cron expression
**Fix:** Enable schedule and verify cron syntax

## üìä Current Configuration

### File-Based Storage
Schedules stored in: `backend/data/schedules/`
- `/schedules/` - Schedule configurations
- `/executions/` - Execution history
- `/approvals/` - Pending approvals

**No database required!** All data is file-based for simplicity.

### Active Jobs (Production)
Based on status endpoint:
- **Jobs Count:** 1
- **Running:** Yes
- **Status:** Healthy

## üéì Best Practices

### Starting Out
1. **Start with approval required** - Review all actions first
2. **Test with small quantities** - Verify workflow works
3. **Use conservative schedules** - Don't over-automate
4. **Monitor execution history** - Check what ran and when

### Advanced Usage
1. **Disable approval for trusted workflows** - After testing
2. **Combine multiple schedules** - Different strategies, different times
3. **Use risk scores** - Set thresholds for auto-approval
4. **Monitor market conditions** - Pause during high volatility

### Safety Tips
- **Never automate with real money** until fully tested
- **Always use paper trading** for scheduler testing
- **Set position limits** in your risk settings
- **Review approval queue** daily
- **Check execution history** weekly
