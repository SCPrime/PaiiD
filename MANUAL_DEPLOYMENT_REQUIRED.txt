   - Create new Render Web Service
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy backend

3. After deployment completes:
   - Note the backend URL Render assigns
   - Report back here with:
     * Backend URL (e.g., https://paiid-backend.onrender.com)
     * Deployment status (success/failed)
     * Any errors encountered

FILES CREATED FOR YOUR REFERENCE:
