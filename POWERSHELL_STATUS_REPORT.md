# PowerShell Status Report (Container Environment)

This environment does **not** have PowerShell Core installed.

## Verification Commands

- `pwsh --version` → `command not found`
- `which pwsh` → no output (executable not present)

## Repository Artifacts

The following files mentioned in the external "comprehensive repair" summary are **absent** from this repository:

- `repair-powershell-deployment.ps1`
- `comprehensive-health-check.ps1`
- `POWERSHELL_DEPLOYMENT_REPAIR_PLAN.md`

These facts were confirmed with `find` lookups across the repository root.

## Conclusion

Because `pwsh` is not available and the referenced automation files are missing, the repair summary from the external source does not reflect the state of this containerized workspace.
