# Phase 1‚Äì6 Fixes Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Prepared By:** Project Automation Agent  
**Reference Roadmap:** `TODO.md` (Phase 0 completion ‚Üí Phase 4 cleanup)

---

## üß≠ Overview
This tracker consolidates the results of **Batches 1‚Äì4** and aligns every fix or follow-up action with the Phase 1‚Äì6 roadmap. It keeps the remediation stream in sync with the priorities captured in `TODO.md`, ensuring the remaining backlog is staged for the next execution window.

| Batch | Completion Window | Primary Focus | Phase Alignment | Current Status |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Batch 1 | Oct 18‚Äì19 | Stabilize core MVP blockers (SSE verification, deployment sanity checks) | Phase 0 Prep | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Batch 2 | Oct 20 | Production telemetry & error hardening (Sentry wiring, logging parity) | Phase 0 Prep / Phase 4 | ‚úÖ Complete (awaiting DSN secret) |
| Batch 3 | Oct 21 | Options trading scaffolding + Tradier parity validation | Phase 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è 500 error outstanding (see bug report) |
| Batch 4 | Oct 22 | Backlog triage + mobile-readiness audit | Phase 0 Prep | ‚è≥ Device testing blocked |

## ‚úÖ Outcomes by Phase (Batches 1‚Äì4)

### Phase 0 ‚Äì MVP Completion
- **Batch 1:** Verified SSE in production and exercised Render deployment smoke tests to confirm parity with `READY_TO_DEPLOY.md`.
- **Batch 2:** Completed Sentry integration hooks; action item remains to supply DSN secret in Render (mirrors `TODO.md` call-out).
- **Batch 4:** Audited mobile export and device test readiness; two checklist items remain blocked pending physical devices.

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Options Trading Bring-up
- **Batch 3:** Implemented options chain scaffolding and surfaced `/api/expirations/{symbol}` 500 failure. Bug is tracked in `BUG_REPORT_OPTIONS_500.md` with monitoring and QA pathways now appended.
- **Carryover:** Greeks calculation, execution wiring, and RadialMenu integration stay queued as ‚ÄúPhase 1: Options Trading (6‚Äì8h)‚Äù in `TODO.md`.

### Phases 2‚Äì6 ‚Äì Forward Planning
- Batches 1‚Äì4 produced no direct Phase 2‚Äì6 code, but backlog notes were refreshed to ensure downstream work respects the **GENIUS ACCELLERATOR** sequencing (see below) and the dependency ordering from `TODO.md`.

---

## üìå Remaining Backlog & Ownership
- **Physical Device Validation (Phase 0 Prep):** `Test chart export on mobile`, `Mobile device testing` ‚Üí needs iPhone & Android hardware access.
- **Options Endpoint Fix (Phase 1):** Resolve 500 error before proceeding to Greeks calculations and execution flows.
- **Phase 2‚Äì4 Warm-Up:** Prep research spikes but defer execution until MVP checkbox clears, matching `TODO.md` gating.

Each backlog item is now mirrored in the `MASTER_BATCH_TASK_LIST.md` for scheduling and in `PLAN_NEXT_STEPS.md` under the GENIUS ACCELLERATOR cadence.

---

## üß† GENIUS ACCELLERATOR Touchpoints
To maintain velocity, every batch summary now tags actions against the sequencing framework:

1. **G**ather operational data (deployment & telemetry health)
2. **E**valuate blockers (physical device gap, 500 error)
3. **N**ormalize backlog to roadmap (`TODO.md` alignment)
4. **I**mplement scoped fixes (Batches 1‚Äì3 complete)
5. **U**pdate stakeholders (see communication summaries)
6. **S**tandardize QA & monitoring handoffs (bug report cross-links)

Phases 5 and 6 remain deferred but will adopt the same loop once prerequisites unlock.

---

## üîÑ Review Cadence
- **Daily stand-up:** Confirm Batch tracker vs. `TODO.md` delta.
- **Twice-weekly audits:** Reconcile monitoring alerts and QA dashboards referenced in the bug report.
- **Phase transition review:** Before Phase 1 coding resumes, ensure Batch 3 bug fix + device blockers are cleared.
