# Analyze Project Completion

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Methodology:** GENIUS ACCELLERATOR retrospective lens  
**Data Sources:** `TODO.md`, `PHASE_STATUS_2025-10-13.md`, `PHASE_1-6_FIXES.md`, `MASTER_BATCH_TASK_LIST.md`

---

## 1. Completion Snapshot
- **Overall MVP Progress:** 98% (Phase 0 prep) ‚Äî remaining gaps require physical device validation.  
- **Phase 1 Readiness:** Architectural scaffolding present, but endpoint 500 bug blocks execution.  
- **Phases 2‚Äì4:** Deferred per roadmap until MVP + Phase 1 obligations clear.  
- **Phases 5‚Äì6:** Largely historical/complete per audits; no new work scheduled.

### Alignment with `TODO.md`
| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 0 Prep | 3/5 tasks done | `TODO.md` In-Progress section, Batch 4 recap |
| Phase 1 | Pending | Options trading tasks listed + Batch 3 bug gate |
| Phase 2 | Blocked | Dependent on Phase 1 completion |
| Phase 3 | Blocked | Dependent on Phase 2 completion |
| Phase 4 | Blocked | Dependent on Phase 3 completion |

## 2. GENIUS ACCELLERATOR Retrospective
- **G (Gather):** Telemetry + audit docs confirm infrastructure stability; Render DSN secret outstanding.  
- **E (Evaluate):** Physical device access + `/api/expirations/{symbol}` bug are the only blockers to call MVP/Phase 1 ‚Äúgreen.‚Äù  
- **N (Normalize):** Backlog reconciled via new `PHASE_1-6_FIXES.md` and `MASTER_BATCH_TASK_LIST.md`.  
- **I (Implement):** Batches 1‚Äì3 delivered fixes; next implementation step is targeted debugging session.  
- **U (Update):** Communication templates ready in `COMMUNICATION_UPDATES_2025-10-22.md`.  
- **S (Standardize):** QA + monitoring linkage inserted into bug report for consistent follow-through.

## 3. Gap Analysis & Recommendations
1. **Physical Device Testing**  
   - *Risk:* MVP sign-off delayed.  
   - *Mitigation:* Prioritize procurement/loan; if not possible within 48h, consider engaging QA vendor.  
2. **Options Endpoint 500**  
   - *Risk:* Phase 1 schedule slips; downstream Greeks/execution tasks blocked.  
   - *Mitigation:* Execute debugger plan, expand automated tests, tie fix to monitoring dashboards for regression coverage.  
3. **Telemetry Finalization**  
   - *Risk:* Reduced visibility post-launch.  
   - *Mitigation:* Provision Sentry DSN, verify alert routing, ensure Slack/Notion updates reflect activation.

## 4. Decision Gates
- ‚úÖ Proceed to Phase 1 once device testing + endpoint fix verified.  
- ‚è≥ Hold Phase 2+ planning until GENIUS steps for blockers reach ‚ÄúS‚Äù (standardized).  
- üõ†Ô∏è Schedule mini-retro after Batch 4 blockers clear to reassess capacity vs. roadmap.
