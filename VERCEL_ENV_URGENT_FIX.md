# üö® URGENT: VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FIX

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** CRITICAL - Requires immediate action
**Problem:** Deployed build still uses localhost:8001 despite source code being fixed

---

## üî• THE PROBLEM

**Browser Error:**
```
POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/claude/chat net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

**Root Cause:**
Vercel's production build is NOT picking up the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` because it's not set in the Vercel dashboard!

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

**Go to:** https://vercel.com/scprimes-projects/ai-trader/settings/environment-variables

**Add these variables:**

| Variable Name | Value | Environments |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` | `https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN` | `rnd_bDRqi1TvLvd3rC78yvUSgDraH2Kl` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | `false` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN` | `https://ai-trader-snowy.vercel.app` | Production, Preview, Development |

### Step 2: Redeploy

After adding the environment variables:

**Option A: Wait for automatic redeploy** (from our empty commit 9e6503b)

**Option B: Manual redeploy**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/scprimes-projects/ai-trader/deployments
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "Redeploy" button
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache" = NO (force fresh build)

### Step 3: Verify

After redeployment completes:
1. Visit https://ai-trader-snowy.vercel.app
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for the error - should be GONE
4. Test AI features - should work!

---

## üîç WHY THIS HAPPENED

### The Timeline:

**1. Source Code (CORRECT):**
```typescript
// frontend/lib/aiAdapter.ts line 64
const backendUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL
                || 'https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com';
```

**2. Local .env.production.local (WAS WRONG, NOW FIXED):**
```bash
# BEFORE:
BACKEND_API_BASE_URL="..."  # ‚ùå Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix

# AFTER:
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL="..."  # ‚úÖ Correct
```

**3. Vercel Dashboard (MISSING):**
```
‚ùå No NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL set
```

**Result:**
- Local builds work (use .env.production.local)
- Vercel builds DON'T work (no env vars set)
- Fallback URL in code should work BUT...
- Webpack/Next.js inlines `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` at BUILD TIME
- If variable is undefined, it stays undefined (fallback never runs!)

---

## üéØ THE TECHNICAL EXPLANATION

### How Next.js Environment Variables Work:

```javascript
// At BUILD TIME, webpack replaces:
const url = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL || 'fallback';

// With:
const url = undefined || 'fallback';  // If env var not set

// But somehow the bundled code has localhost???
// This means there WAS an old value cached!
```

### The Cache Problem:

Vercel's build cache may have preserved OLD bundled JavaScript from when the code DID have localhost URLs. Our commits fixed the SOURCE, but the BUNDLE wasn't rebuilt.

**Solution:** Force fresh build + set environment variables properly

---

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After applying the fix:

- [ ] Environment variables added to Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Fresh deployment triggered (no cache)
- [ ] Browser console shows NO localhost errors
- [ ] AI chat features work
- [ ] Morning routine works
- [ ] Strategy builder works
- [ ] Browser test: `fetch('https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com/api/claude/chat', {method: 'POST', headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify({messages: [{role: 'user', content: 'test'}], max_tokens: 10})}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)`

---

## üé® WHAT WE LEARNED

### Key Insights:

1. **Local .env files don't deploy to Vercel** - Must set in dashboard
2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix is REQUIRED** for client-side code
3. **Build cache can preserve old bundles** - Force fresh builds when needed
4. **Fallback URLs don't help** if webpack inlines undefined at build time

### Best Practice:

**ALWAYS** set environment variables in Vercel dashboard for production, not just rely on fallbacks in code!

## üèÜ COMMITS MADE

```bash
9e6503b - chore: force Vercel rebuild to pick up localhost fixes
03d79ab - fix: clean infrastructure configs - remove all stale references
b50aa48 - fix: replace all localhost fallback URLs with production backend
```

**Local Fix:**
- `frontend/.env.production.local` - Fixed variable names (not committed)

**Still Needed:**
- Vercel dashboard environment variables (manual step)

---

## üí¨ FOR THE TEAM

**Dr. Claude Desktop was RIGHT!** üéØ

> "The deployed build is still OLD"

Even though our source code was fixed, the BUNDLED JavaScript served by Vercel still had localhost references. This is because:

1. ‚úÖ Source code IS fixed (commits b50aa48, 03d79ab)
2. ‚ùå Vercel env vars NOT set (dashboard configuration missing)
3. ‚ùå Build cache may have old bundles

**The Fix:** Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard + force fresh build

---

**Status:** ‚è≥ WAITING FOR VERCEL DASHBOARD UPDATE

Once environment variables are set and fresh deployment completes, the error will be GONE! ‚úÖ
