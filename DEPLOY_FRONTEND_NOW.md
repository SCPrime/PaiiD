5. Assigns you a URL
```

### **Your Live URLs:**
```
Frontend: https://paiid-frontend.onrender.com

Progress: https://scprime.github.io/PaiiD/ (dashboard)
```

- Verify backend is running (green in Render dashboard)
- Wait 30 sec if backend was sleeping (free tier)

- Check NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL is correct
