**File:** `frontend/components/StoryboardCanvas.tsx` (1,050 lines)

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Screenshot capture using html2canvas
- ✅ 5 annotation tools:
  - Select (↖) - Navigation mode
  - Arrow (→) - Point to UI elements
  - Box (□) - Highlight regions
  - Text (T) - Add detailed comments
  - Highlight (▮) - Translucent overlays

- ✅ Save/load/delete versions
- ✅ Export to PNG
- ✅ Export to PDF
- ✅ Text annotation modal with keyboard shortcuts (Enter/Escape)
- ✅ Canvas drawing with mouse drag support
- ✅ Version preview thumbnails

**Architecture:**
- Self-contained modal component with dark glassmorphic UI

- LocalStorage persistence for version history
- Canvas-based rendering for annotations
- Real-time preview during drawing

### 2. Global Hotkey Manager

- ✅ Modifier key support (Ctrl, Shift, Alt)
- ✅ Input field detection (prevents hotkeys when typing)
- ✅ Debug mode for development
- ✅ Human-readable display strings
- ✅ OS-specific modifier detection (Cmd on Mac, Ctrl on Windows)

**Default Hotkeys Configured:**
- **Ctrl + Shift + S** → Open Storyboard Canvas
- **Ctrl + K** → Open AI Chat
- **Ctrl + T** → Quick Trade
- **Ctrl + P** → View Positions
- **Ctrl + R** → Research
- **Escape** → Close Modal
- **Ctrl + ,** → Settings
- **Ctrl + /** → Help

### 3. Integrated _app.tsx
**File:** `frontend/pages/_app.tsx` (272 lines)

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Imported StoryboardCanvas component
- ✅ Imported hotkeyManager with default hotkeys
- ✅ Added storyboard state management
- ✅ Registered global hotkeys on mount
- ✅ Added floating storyboard button (60px circle, draggable)
- ✅ Draggable button logic with viewport bounds
- ✅ Button animations (hover effects, pulse)
- ✅ Cleanup hotkeys on unmount

**Button Features:**
- Purple circular button (📋 clipboard icon)
- Bottom-right default position
- Fully draggable to any screen position
- Constrained within viewport bounds
- Hover effects: scale 1.1x, enhanced glow
- Tooltip: "Storyboard Mode (Ctrl+Shift+S)"

### 4. User Documentation

**Contents:**
- How to activate storyboard mode (2 methods)
- Detailed tool explanations with use cases
- Color coding best practices
- Version history management
- Export/sharing workflows
- Keyboard shortcuts reference
- 5 common use case examples:
  1. UI bug reporting
  2. Design iteration
  3. User flow documentation
  4. Client/stakeholder feedback
  5. Responsive design planning
- Tips & tricks section
- Troubleshooting guide
- MVP limitations and future roadmap

### 5. Dependencies Installed
```bash
npm install html2canvas jspdf react-sketch-canvas
npm install --save-dev @types/html2canvas
```

**Packages Added:**
- `html2canvas` - Screenshot capture
- `jspdf` - PDF export functionality
- `react-sketch-canvas` - Drawing utilities (future use)
- `@types/html2canvas` - TypeScript definitions

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Screenshot Capture Flow
1. User clicks "Capture Screenshot" or presses Ctrl+Shift+S
2. Modal temporarily hidden (`display: none`)
3. 100ms delay for re-render
4. `html2canvas` captures `document.body`
5. Canvas converted to PNG dataURL
6. Modal restored
7. Image displayed in canvas editor

### Annotation Rendering
1. Screenshot loaded as base image
2. Canvas dimensions set to image dimensions
3. All saved annotations drawn in order
4. Current annotation (if drawing) drawn last
5. Canvas updates on every state change

### Version System
- Versions stored as JSON in localStorage
- Key: `storyboard-versions`
- Each version contains:
  - `id` - Unique timestamp-based ID
  - `timestamp` - Unix timestamp
  - `imageDataUrl` - Base64 PNG string
  - `annotations` - Array of annotation objects
  - `title` - User-provided name

### Hotkey System Architecture
```typescript
HotkeyManager (Singleton)
├── bindings: Map<signature, HotkeyBinding>
├── register(id, config) → Add new hotkey
├── unregister(id) → Remove hotkey
├── handleKeyDown(event) → Process keypresses
└── buildSignature(key, modifiers) → "ctrl+shift+s"
```

**Signature Format:** `modifier+modifier+key` (e.g., `ctrl+shift+s`)

---

## Code Quality Metrics

### TypeScript Compliance
- ✅ All files pass TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Proper interface definitions for props
- ✅ Type guards for null checks
- ✅ No `any` types (except html2canvas config workaround)

### React Best Practices
- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ Proper useEffect cleanup functions
- ✅ Event listener removal on unmount
- ✅ State colocation (no prop drilling)
- ✅ Conditional rendering patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Canvas rendering only on state changes
- Event listeners added/removed dynamically
- LocalStorage writes batched (save button)
- Image compression via canvas toDataURL
- Draggable button uses `requestAnimationFrame` implicitly

---

## User Experience Highlights

### Visual Design
- **Dark theme** with glassmorphic effects
- **Purple accent** color for storyboard branding
- **Smooth animations** (scale, glow, transitions)
- **Clear visual hierarchy** (header → tools → canvas → versions)

### Accessibility
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Tooltips on all interactive elements
- Descriptive button labels
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Error Handling
- Screenshot capture errors show alerts
- Canvas API failures gracefully handled
- LocalStorage full errors caught
- Validation on text input

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Press Ctrl+Shift+S to open storyboard
- [ ] Capture screenshot of dashboard
- [ ] Test each annotation tool (arrow, box, text, highlight)
- [ ] Change colors and verify rendering
- [ ] Undo last annotation
- [ ] Clear all annotations
- [ ] Save a version with custom title
- [ ] Load previous version
- [ ] Delete version
- [ ] Export PNG (check download)
- [ ] Export PDF (check download)
- [ ] Drag floating button around screen
- [ ] Test Escape key to close modal
- [ ] Test hotkeys while typing in input field (should not trigger)

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge** - Full support (tested)
- **Firefox** - Should work (untested)
- **Safari** - May need CORS tweaks for html2canvas
- **Mobile** - Not optimized (desktop-first)
