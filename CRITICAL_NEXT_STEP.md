# üö® CRITICAL NEXT STEP - CHECK VERCEL BUILD LOGS

**Date:** 2025-10-10 23:35 UTC
**Status:** üî¥ **VERCEL NOT LOADING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

---

## üìä CURRENT SITUATION

**Good News:**
- ‚úÖ New build ID deployed: `Va4J7L0LYuv0LUea1-cno` (was `pUDv6J1kUDNG6TwNgY_zB`)
- ‚úÖ vercel.json has correct environment variables (commit ba44204)
- ‚úÖ Source code has correct fallback URL
- ‚úÖ "Ignored Build Step" set to "Don't ignore"

**Bad News:**
- ‚ùå Bundle STILL has `127.0.0.1:8001`
- ‚ùå Bundle has ZERO occurrences of `ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com`
- ‚ùå Same bundle filename: `index-62f8d916f1a728ba.js`

---

## üîç THE PROBLEM

**Webpack is NOT receiving the environment variable during build!**

### Evidence:

```typescript
// Source code (aiAdapter.ts:64):
const backendUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL || 'https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com';

// What SHOULD happen at build time:
// Webpack sees: NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL = "https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com"
// Inlines: const backendUrl = "https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com";

// What's ACTUALLY happening:
// Webpack sees: NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL = undefined
// Somehow becomes: const backendUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8001";  ‚Üê WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?!
```

## üö® CRITICAL QUESTION

**WHERE IS `127.0.0.1:8001` COMING FROM?**

This is NOT in our source code! Possible sources:

1. **Cached `.env` file in Vercel?**
   - Vercel might have cached an old `.env` file
   - This file might have had `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001`

2. **Vercel Dashboard Environment Variables?**
   - Even though we set them, they might be WRONG
   - Or they might be overriding the vercel.json

3. **Vercel Build Cache?**
   - Despite unchecking "Use existing Build Cache"
   - Some deeper cache layer is preserving the old value

4. **next.config.js or another config file?**
   - Some configuration somewhere has `127.0.0.1:8001` hardcoded

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW

### STEP 1: Check Vercel Build Logs (CRITICAL!)

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/scprimes-projects/ai-trader/deployments

2. **Find the deployment** with build ID: `Va4J7L0LYuv0LUea1-cno`
   - Should be the most recent "Ready" deployment

3. **Click on that deployment**

4. **Click "View Build Logs" or "Logs" tab**

5. **Search the logs for:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL`
   - Press Ctrl+F and search
   - Look for lines like:
     ```
     Setting environment variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL=...
     ```
   - **WHAT VALUE DOES IT SHOW?**

6. **Also search for:** `127.0.0.1`
   - Is this value appearing in the logs?
   - Where is it coming from?

7. **Screenshot or copy/paste the relevant log lines** showing environment variable loading

---

### STEP 2: Check Vercel Dashboard Environment Variables

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/scprimes-projects/ai-trader/settings/environment-variables

2. **Check if these are set:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN`

3. **If they ARE set:**
   - **WHAT VALUES DO THEY HAVE?**
   - Are they correct (`https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com`)?
   - Or wrong (`http://127.0.0.1:8001`)?

4. **If they are WRONG:**
   - Delete them
   - Let vercel.json handle it (we already have the correct values there)

5. **If they are CORRECT but being ignored:**
   - This is a Vercel bug/configuration issue
   - We may need to contact Vercel support

---

### STEP 3: Nuclear Option - Delete Vercel Project Cache

If the logs show the environment variable is correct but the bundle still has localhost:

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/scprimes-projects/ai-trader/settings/general

2. **Look for:** "Delete Deployment Cache" or similar option

3. **Click it** to completely clear all cached data

4. **Then redeploy** again

---

## üìã WHAT TO REPORT BACK

Please provide:

### 1. Build Log Environment Variables
```
From build logs for deployment Va4J7L0LYuv0LUea1-cno:

Environment variables loaded:
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL = [PASTE VALUE HERE]
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN = [PASTE VALUE HERE]

(Or paste relevant log lines showing env var loading)
```

### 2. Dashboard Environment Variables
```
From Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:

‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL = [VALUE?]
‚úÖ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN = [VALUE?]

(Or "Not set" if they don't exist)
```

### 3. Any Errors in Build Logs
```
Paste any error messages, warnings, or suspicious log lines
```

---

## üí° HYPOTHESIS

**Most Likely Scenario:**

The Vercel dashboard has environment variables set to WRONG values (localhost), and these are **overriding** the correct values in vercel.json.

**Vercel's precedence:**
```
Dashboard Environment Variables (highest priority)
  ‚Üì OVERRIDES
vercel.json environment variables
  ‚Üì OVERRIDES
.env files (not committed, so not used in Vercel)
```

**If dashboard has:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL = http://127.0.0.1:8001  ‚Üê WRONG!
```

**Then even though vercel.json has:**
```json
"env": {
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL": "https://ai-trader-86a1.onrender.com"
}
```

**Dashboard wins!** And webpack inlines `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX (If Hypothesis is Correct)

**Delete the wrong environment variables from Vercel dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/scprimes-projects/ai-trader/settings/environment-variables

2. Find: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL`

3. If it exists and has the WRONG value (`127.0.0.1`):
   - Click the three dots (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢)
   - Click "Delete"
   - Confirm deletion

4. Same for `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN` if it's wrong

5. **Redeploy** (vercel.json values will now be used)

6. **Verify** bundle has production URL

---

## üéØ ACTION ITEMS

**Immediate (YOU):**
1. ‚è∞ Check Vercel build logs (deployment `Va4J7L0LYuv0LUea1-cno`)
2. ‚è∞ Check Vercel dashboard environment variables
3. ‚è∞ Report back what values you find

**After your report (ME):**
1. Analyze the log output
2. Determine exact root cause
3. Provide specific fix instructions

---

## ‚è∞ THIS IS THE FINAL BLOCKER

We've fixed EVERYTHING else:
- ‚úÖ Source code correct
- ‚úÖ vercel.json correct
- ‚úÖ "Ignored Build Step" correct
- ‚úÖ Commits pushed
- ‚úÖ CI passing
- ‚úÖ Deployments happening

**The ONLY thing left is figuring out where `127.0.0.1:8001` is being loaded from during the Vercel build!**

**The build logs will tell us!**

---

**Status:** üî¥ **NEED VERCEL BUILD LOG ANALYSIS**

**Next Step:** Check build logs and dashboard env vars

**ETA to Resolution:** 5-10 minutes once we see the logs
