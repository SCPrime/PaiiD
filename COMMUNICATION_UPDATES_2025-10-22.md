## 1. Slack Stand-up Template
```
:rocket: *PaiiD Daily Update – Oct 22*
• GENIUS Stage: U (Update)
• MVP Status: 98% – waiting on physical device testing (iPhone + Android loaner pending)
• Phase 1 Status: Options scaffolding ready; `/api/expirations/{symbol}` still returning 500 (debug session scheduled)
• Monitoring: Sentry DSN secret outstanding; once added we’ll validate via Render dashboard
• Next Actions: Secure devices (<48h), run pdb tracing on options endpoint, update batch tracker post-debug
```

## 2. Notion Weekly Digest Block
```
**PaiiD Progress – Week of Oct 21**
Status: Yellow (MVP blockers present)
GENIUS ACCELLERATOR Loop: Currently executing steps N→I (normalizing backlog + implementing fixes)
Highlights:
- Batch 4 surfaced mobile testing gap; awaiting physical hardware to finish Phase 0 checklist
- Batch 3 documented options 500 bug with full monitoring/QA linkage
- Batch 2 integration ready; DSN secret addition remains open with DevOps
Risks:
- Device access delay pushes MVP sign-off
- Options endpoint unresolved blocks Phase 1 go-live
Next Milestones:
- Device validation + bug fix -> flip status to Green
- Begin Phase 1 Greeks + execution sprint (6–8h) once blockers cleared
```

## 3. Timeline Snapshot
- **Physical Device Testing:** Target completion 24 Oct (dependent on hardware availability).  
- **Options Endpoint Debug:** Session scheduled 23 Oct; expect resolution or follow-up plan same day.  
- **Phase 1 Build Kick-off:** Earliest start 24–25 Oct if blockers clear.  
- **Scheduler UI Parallel Track:** Optional pick-up after MVP sign-off; maintain low priority per `TODO.md`.

## 4. Blocker Highlight (Copy/Paste)
> :warning: *Physical Device Testing* – MVP remains at 98% until iPhone & Android validation is complete. Please escalate if hardware is not secured by EOD Oct 23.
